            <h3>
                    India’s first outdoor transformational festival
            </h3>
            <p>                    
                    Bloom in Green Festival, India’s first ever outdoor transformational festival, is an eclectic mix of art,
		music, adventure and culture. The event will feature various art and sustainability-related workshops,
		on-site art projects, symposium on ecology and sustainable living and live music. This 3-days camping
		festival is a value system that celebrates life, personal growth, healthy living and creative expressions.
	   </p>
	   <p>
		Transformational festivals are a cultural global phenomenon that has been catering to this need of
		communal celebrations for some time now. They are a content rich reality that features high-density
		quality interactions. They are essentially co-created affairs and all the participants will be active co-
		creators of the festival.
	   </p>
	   <p>
		Bloom in Green 2019 revolves wholly around the six pillars of transformation.
           </p>
		<h3>Sustainability</h3>
		<p>
			we aim at steering the transformation of culture towards sustainability. BIG, being a fully plastic-free
			event features various workshops and symposiums on ecology and sustainable living addressing topics
			such as minimalism, up-cycled art, urban gardening, healthy eating, permaculture, water harvesting and
			so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Community</h3>
		<p>
			With BIG, we focus on creating a meaningful space, where we can gather and celebrate life with art &amp;
			music, educate, connect, heal and inspire. The festival features various community events like drum
			circle, dress-exchange parties, community ecstatic dance sessions, group meditations, on-site art
			projects, jamming sessions and so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>
			Art is unique in its ability to tell a story, to touch people in different ways, to create a connection and to
			make us human. Without a creative outlet, human life is futile. Painting, sculpting, building, singing,
			dancing, writing, and creating are all valid expressions of thought.
			BIG has always been a place for creative expression to flourish. This year we present a variety of
			workshops on art like visionary painting, dream catcher making, contact improvisation, light painting,
			and graffiti and so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Adventure</h3>
		<p>
			Adventure plays its part as the trigger to dive deep into oneself. It gives us a life where we do not know
			what the next moment will bring. One is left alone to become conscious of their very existence, to
			become alive to every breath, and to sit up and take notice of just how much life there is in every
			moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adventure is a newly added element to BIG. And we have the best adventure mate for it: Varanashi
			Organic Farm– The land of nature pools, our venue partner! BIG features various workshops on
			adventure sports like slacklining, SUP paddling, skate boarding and so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>
		At BIG, we are setting a platform for all those musicians who think that they can vibe with our tribe. .
		For the BIG tribe, music will be a connecting factor as there will be an opportunity to try out new
		instruments through workshops, jamming sessions and much more.
		</p>
		<h3>Mindful Living</h3>
		<p>
		BIG, as a multi-facet platform tries to bring in new experiential openings and features ceremonies and
		workshops like sound healing sessions, tantric workshop, plant medicines, and sun set ceremonies and
		so on.
